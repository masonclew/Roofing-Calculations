# Roofing-Calculations-Javascript
Javascript program that takes the shape, dimensions, and material of a roof face and outputs a cost and time estimate.
Can be used by customers to get an idea of the cost and time commitment of replacing their roof. 
Developed as a Javascript app in Code.org for my AP Computer Science Principles exam project.
